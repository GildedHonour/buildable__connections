# What are Sources?

A [Source](/sources/catalog/) is a tool in your stack that can send backend events to Buildable. They work natively to trigger [Buildable Workflows](https://docs.buildable.dev/workflows/building-workflows), which means you can build, test, deploy any logic from incoming Source events. There are three types of sources: 

- Cloud apps, such as Stripe, Twilio and SendGrid
- Databases, such as MongoDB, PostgreSQL and MySQL
- Servers, such as a web server you run internally

Check out the [contribution guidelines](/sources/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) to start creating your own Source Connections.
