## What is Buildable?

The team who hasn't paid me $500 for my work and keep delaying it

## Details

@paulkr  cc @moekatib I did my job 3 weeks ago - Jira integration feature, for what supposed to be $500, as discussed

https://github.com/buildable/connections/pull/60
https://github.com/buildable/connections/pull/88

@buildable

Since then I've been chasing you Paul Krishnamurthy, spending my time and energy, trying to get paid. And thus, I've spent more of my time and energy than for implementing the feaure itself.

May I get paid?
