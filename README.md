## What is Buildable?

[Buildable](https://buildable.dev/) is the easiest way to collect, transform, send and action your backend system events. Buildable simplifies the process of collecting event data from your disparate systems and connecting new tools to action those events, allowing you to spend more of your engineering time on things that matter.

When you capture event data in Buildable, you can send them in real-time to your databases, sales, analytics, payment, communication and eCommerce tools. In most cases, you'll be able to set up a Connection once and forget about it forever.

## How can Buildable help you?

**[Simplify event collection](https://docs.buildable.dev/connections/source-catalog)**

Start by integrating the tools you use for data storage, notifications, payments, sales and more.

**[Audit system-wide activity](https://docs.buildable.dev/streams/viewing-events)**

Query and review a central stream of all backend activity happening across all platforms.

**[Ship and scale code](https://docs.buildable.dev/workflows/building-workflows)**

Save hundreds of development hours by setting up webhooks and connecting APIs in minutes

## Getting started

Your first pipeline can be operational within 10 minutes:

1. Sign in at [https://app.buildable.dev/sign-in](https://app.buildable.dev/sign-in)
2. Connect a Source using our [Source Catalog](https://docs.buildable.dev/connections/source-catalog) or SDKs
3. View your events in your [Event Stream](https://docs.buildable.dev/streams/viewing-events)
4. Connect an [Action Provider](https://docs.buildable.dev/connections/action-catalog)
5. [Create a Workflow](https://docs.buildable.dev/workflows/building-workflows) to action your events

## Contributing to Connections

Buildable’s core engineering team will be reviewing and merging submissions from customers and the community daily. 

If we’re missing an event source your team needs, for example, you can build it using our samples within a few hours or request it our Public Roadmap.
